# Panel
**fruithost** is an OpenSource Hosting-Panel for some Linux Distributions (later maybe also for Windows). With **fruithost** you get a real alternative to confixx/Plesk, ISPConfig, froxlor and other derivatives.

Whether **private or professional**, with **fruithost** you get a clean and simple solution to manage your servers.

Security comes first at **fruithost** - that's why we only use up-to-date software and do without miserable old solutions. If you have an [MIT license](https://github.com/fruithost/Panel/blob/master/LICENSE), you can use **fruithost** for any scenario!

**Running a server has never been so easy!**
